# The mod index api

[![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/ReviversMC/the-mod-index.svg)]

This is meant as a Java/other JVM languages api to access [the-mod-index](https://github.com/reviversmc/the-mod-index).
It will be officially maintained by ReviversMC.
Get it on Jitpack!  
The api does rely on 2 dependencies in order to work:
- [Moshi by Square](https://github.com/square/moshi/)
- [OkHttp by Square](https://github.com/square/okhttp/)

If you have a maintained community version of the api in some other language, do let us know, and we'd be happy to feature it.
