# The mod index api

[![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/reviversmc/the-mod-index-api.svg?label=Release)](https://jitpack.io/#reviversmc/the-mod-index-api)

It will be officially maintained by ReviversMC. We follow the versioning scheme of `index version-api version`.  
Get it on Jitpack!  
The api does rely on 2 dependencies in order to work:
- [Moshi by Square](https://github.com/square/moshi/)
- [OkHttp by Square](https://github.com/square/okhttp/)

If you have a maintained community version of the api in some other language, do let us know, and we'd be happy to feature it.
