# The mod index api

[![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/reviversmc/the-mod-index-api.svg?label=Release)](https://jitpack.io/#reviversmc/the-mod-index-api)

It will be officially maintained by ReviversMC. We follow the versioning scheme of `index version-api version`.  
The api is written in Kotlin, and is best used with Kotlin. Regardless, it should still remain functional on Java.

Get it on Jitpack!  
KDocs can be found at [https://reviversmc.github.io/the-mod-index-api/](https://reviversmc.github.io/the-mod-index-api/).
## Community apis
If you have a community maintained version of the api in some other language, do let us know, and we'd be happy to feature it.
