# The mod index api

[![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/reviversmc/the-mod-index-api.svg?label=Release)](https://jitpack.io/#reviversmc/the-mod-index-api)

It will be officially maintained by ReviversMC. We follow the versioning scheme of `index version-api version`.  
The api is written in Kotlin, and is best used with Kotlin. Regardless, it should still remain functional on Java.

Get it on Jitpack!  
Javadoc can be found at `https://javadoc.jitpack.io/com/github/reviversmc/the-mod-index-api/VERSION/javadoc/`, 
where `VERSION` is the version of the api (e.g. the version in the button above).

## Community apis
If you have a community maintained version of the api in some other language, do let us know, and we'd be happy to feature it.
